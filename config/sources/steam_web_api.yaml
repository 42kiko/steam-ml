# Local configuration for the Steam Web API ingestor.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - Do NOT commit your real key to a public repository.
# - You can leave a placeholder here in Git and set the real key locally.
#
# Resolution order in code:
# 1. STEAM_API_KEY environment variable
# 2. auth.api_key in config/sources/steam_web_api.local.yaml (git-ignored, local only)
# 3. auth.api_key in this file (or steam.api_key / api_key)

# This file is safe to commit with a placeholder key. Do NOT commit real keys.
# Each developer can create steam_web_api.local.yaml locally with their real key.

auth:
  api_key: "CHANGE_ME_WITH_YOUR_STEAM_WEB_API_KEY"

# Example for a local override file (NOT committed):
#
#   config/sources/steam_web_api.local.yaml
#
#   auth:
#     api_key: "REAL_STEAM_WEB_API_KEY"
