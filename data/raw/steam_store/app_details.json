Like the behaviours of the characters, the music too is never exactly the same twice.                    <br>\t\t\t\t\tFor a satisfying experience, it takes about 6 hours to complete the game.",

If you dance for me you may ask of me what you will, and I will give it you, even unto the half of my kingdom.&quot;​</strong></i><br><br>Salome was a first century Judean princess mentioned in the Christian Bible by Matthew and by Mark. But it is Oscar Wilde's 19th century play Salome that really inspired Fatale. In the Bible, Salome is a child who dances for King Herod and asks the head of John the Baptist as a reward. In Wilde's version, Salome falls in love with the prophet. He rejects her and she has him executed. The play ends with her kissing the lips of his decapitated head.<br><br>Most of Fatale takes place in the aftermath of this event, when all has turned quiet and the moon brings comfort to troubled hearts.<br><br>Explore a living tableau filled with references to the legendary tale of Salome and enjoy the moonlit serenity of a fatal night in the orient.

Pursued by a notorious cut-throat Pirate Hunter and a creepy French Physician who believes that Guybrush's eerily-infected hand holds the secret of eternal life, Threepwood sails the seven seas in search of La Esponja Grande, a legendary sea sponge with unparalleled voodoo exfoliating abilities. But little does Guybrush know, his quest is part of a larger, more sinister plot, and good and evil are not always as they seem...<br>                    Who can Guybrush trust? Where can he turn?

What has become of LeChuck and Elaine? And what's the story with the infectious voodoo pox that's spreading across the Caribbean, causing Guybrush and other pirates to act like unruly hooligans?

      "supported_languages": "English",
      "reviews": "“This is an entry in the series that long-time fans will love… the game delivers strong in so many ways that you will look over any of the weak puzzles and enjoy another outing with Nancy, the Hardys, and the usual collection of goofy and humorous characters (even a recurring character from a previous mystery!), accompanied by dialogue that’s more crisp and witty than it has been in a while.”<br>Just Adventure<br><br>“The game offers hours of thrilling detective work. As all the Nancy Drew games, Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon is targeted to mystery fans ages 10 to adult. It is worth noting that this is the kind of game that can be particularly enjoyable to play with other people. You can have a wonderful time discovering the mystery with a friend or family member. Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon can be easily recommended to adventure and mystery fans.”<br>Adventure Lantern<br><br>“These puzzles are varied, logical, and make sense in the train’s historical context, and there is something simply enjoyable about investigating the different characters and piecing together clues to the mystery of both Lori Girard’s disappearance and Jake’s old mine. Although more could have been made to involve them in the investigation, the introduction of the Hardy Boys is also a nice reward for longtime Nancy Drew fans.”<br>Adventure Gamers<br>",

You really feel like you’re Nancy, rolling up your sleeves and getting to the bottom of things without any nonsense.”<br>Just Adventure<br><br>“So how did they do? In short, they did well. The graphics, characters, game play, innovations and ambiance all added up to a captivating time with my favorite girl sleuth.”<br>Game Boomers<br><br>“Parents of teens know how hard it is to find games for their kids which don’t have graphic violence and sexual content. Her Interactive has done an excellent job with this series in providing challenging adventures which are fun and engaging, and which are culturally relevant to today’s teen, without resorting to the programming laziness of cheap sex and extreme violence. The Haunted Carousel is a great game to get for kids ages 12-16 (and older and younger, too).”<br>PC GameZone<br>",

      "reviews": "“Deception Island is truly the game that Nancy Drew and mystery fans have been waiting for. The puzzles are better, the concept is better, and the historical piece of the puzzle is intriguing, as well.”<br>Just Adventure<br><br>“Deception Island to me has it all: a wide range of game environments, a host of credible characters, well-crafted graphics and ambiance, and a great plot that weaves the curiosities of the past with the present day mysteries into one entertaining package. Then they threw in some diverting side events just for fun. Toss it all together and you have one charming game, sure to give adventure players their money’s worth and more. So without any reservations, I highly recommend this game.”<br>GameBoomers<br><br>“In short, there is much to recommend Nancy Drew: Danger on Deception Island. Unless you’re already something of a nautical buff, you’ll learn a lot about sailing and whales. It’s a very creative game, and I can’t imagine a better title for your child to enjoy.”<br>Armchair Arcade<br>",

      "reviews": "“A great adventure game that will require thought and perseverance to finish. The story is exciting and offers a little spookiness in the beginning; in fact, some younger players may be scared at first, which parents should be aware of. Whether your kids are Nancy Drew fans or not, this game will interest most teens and many adults, as well.”<br>PC GameZone<br><br>“Ghost Dogs isn’t a bad little game and deserves the FFC thumb up! It’s the perfect game for a beginner just starting out or an experienced adventurer looking for a mystery that isn’t too tough on those “little grey cells.””<br>FourFatChicks<br><br>“I would recommend any and all of the titles in this series to adventure gamers everywhere. Of the lot, Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake is one of the best. I am pleased that Her Interactive acquired the rights to produce these games, and that there are more to come. I think that if you want the gaming equivalent of slipping into your favorite PJs and coziest chair for an engaging and fun mental diversion, you can’t go wrong with Nancy Drew in general, and Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake in particular. So with that in mind, this reviewer highly recommends Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake.”<br>Mr. Bill’s Adventureland<br>",

If you’re looking for light entertainment and solid gameplay, Legend of the Crystal Skull is worth your dollar.”<br>Just Adventure<br><br>“This game is quite fun to play. The story is interesting and fairly long, and the puzzles are engaging. Young sleuths will keep playing to the end to find out the culprit.”<br>PG GameZone<br><br>“I have no problems in saying this is the best game in the series that I’ve played, and I have played a lot of them. The upgrades to the character models are now a match for the excellent voice work and sharp dialogue that has always characterized the series, and is continued in Legend of Crystal Skull.”<br>Adventure Gamers<br>",

      "reviews": "“The good news is that the mini-games are designed well and offer engaging play (I really enjoyed MasterMind!), and the atmosphere of the 1930’s is also fun.”<br>PC GameZone<br><br>“The Secret of the Old Clock brings the number of games in the Nancy Drew series to an even dozen. While this is an impressive accomplishment for any series, that’s not Clock’s only distinction. The game is based on the first book in the Nancy Drew canon, the game’s release date is the 75th anniversary of that book’s publication, and the game is done in period, right down to Nancy’s more-or-less Model A roadster. Clock carries all this baggage effortlessly, providing players with one of the most sprightly entries in the series.”<br>FourFatChicks<br><br>“Like a cake, Her Interactive has all the ingredients – dialogue, voice work, and story – to cook up a confection that will be enjoyed by both Junior and Senior detectives. They even add a few new things such as an in-game map and a roadster (cool!) to get around in.”<br>Adventure Gamers<br>",

Lovers of adventure games who’ve maybe stayed away from this series because they think these games are “for kids” might want to take this opportunity to check out what HerInteractive is doing. This isn’t just an excellent Nancy Drew game, it’s an excellent adventure game, period.”<br>Just Adventure<br><br>“I would recommend this to anyone who wants a challenging mystery and isn’t afraid of the unexpected.”<br>PC GameZone<br><br>“It is clear from talking to Emily that she enjoyed this game as much as the others, although in a slightly different way… As she indicated above, its differences were such that she wasn’t able to compare it to the others in terms of how much she liked it – when I asked that question she responded “it wasn’t better or worse, it was different”. She is already looking forward to the next one, so Her Interactive must continue to be pleased with their product.”<br>Metzomagic<br>",

As I have said time and time again, do not be confused into thinking this and other Nancy Drew games are only good for children and young teens. They are quality entertainment for anyone who enjoys adventuring and puzzle solving. This latest installment is among the best of the bunch, and anyone who has been missing out on this great series must consider picking it up.” - Adventure Classic Gaming",

      "reviews": "“Nancy Drew fans will NOT be disappointed in this latest installment. It’s a solid game effort by Her Interactive and those who might have been passing on the Nancy Drew series might just want to give this one a try. In my opinion, The White Wolf of Icicle Creek is an excellent step in the right direction.”<br />\r\nJust Adventure<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“Suitable for all ages, the game also contains some educational tidbits on wildlife and brain-teasing puzzles that may make it a good choice for children and families, though prospective buyers may want to note that there are some characters that fall into possibly offensive racial stereotypes. In any case, though, it’s a decent adventure game, and fans of the series will probably find it worthwhile to take a look.”<br />\r\nGame Chronicles<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“At the end of the day, Nancy Drew: The White Wolf of Icicle Creek is everything we have come to expect from this series of games. It has nicely enmeshed puzzles peppered throughout the game, a number of quirky characters to interact with and a solidly written dialogue.”<br />\r\nAdventure Gamers<br />\r\n",

You will be provided with explosives to help you gain access to the teleports from where thousands of pitiless creatures pour. A stationary gun will aid in the defense of the area.

It gives kids the opportunity to interact with virtual animals...to pet, play fetch, and feed them, and provides interesting information about their behavioral patterns. What's more, the game teaches the basics of managing a pet grooming business by rewarding players with money that needs to be reinvested to build more attractions, buy more food, and attract more customers.”<br>Common Sense Media<br>",

Also protected by distinctive Gempei-period armour which gives excellent protection at range and in melee.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Sword Attendants</strong> – Armed with huge two-handed swords, these fearsome warriors can carve a bloody path in melee.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </li></ul></li><li>4 new Hero units – the Naginata Warrior Monk Hero, the Tetsubo Warrior Monk Hero, the Mounted Samurai Hero and the Onna Bushi Heroine.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t <ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Onna Bushi Heroine</strong> – Armed with Naginata and bow, these female Samurai are versatile cavalry units who excel in melee. Do not doubt the courage of a woman…<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Tetsubo Warrior Monk Hero</strong> – armed with iron-studded clubs, these Monks are devastating in melee as they bash their way through their foes.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </li></ul></li><li>10 new naval units and 3 new naval special abilities (&quot;Banzai!,&quot; &quot;Whistling Arrows&quot; and &quot;Rally&quot;)<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   </li><li>4 new agent types with their own unique skill trees:<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t <ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>The Shirabyoshi</strong> uses seduction to convince her target to join her family’s cause, and to distract enemy armies. She is also able to entertain the nobles of friendly towns in order to boost their growth and entertain friendly generals in the field, which increases their loyalty to the family and counteracts the efforts of enemy agents attempting to bribe or seduce them into changing sides.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>The Junsatsushi</strong> can request the allegiance of neutral and enemy castle towns, along with any forces garrisoned there. He ensures loyalty and obedience from friendly generals, increases income by preventing corruption, and keeps your castle towns and armies safe from enemy subterfuge when stationed there. He can also pay off rival agents.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>The Monomi</strong> acts as an assassin, spy, saboteur and scout. He can establish spy networks within your castle towns, which increases the chances of discovering any rival agents and armies that may be hiding within a province.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>The Sou</strong> can inspire a friendly army or pacify an angry populace with his enlightened rhetoric. Likewise, he can demoralise an enemy force, reduce the chances of successful bribery, indoctrinate enemy agents and cause them to retire, or incite an enemy population to revolt.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </li></ul></li><li>New historical scenario – the Battle of Anegawa (1570)<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"bb_ul\"></ul></li></ul>",

      "detailed_description": "Destroy the Luftwaffe!<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>There’s something new in the air, and it’s more than the hum of hundreds of aero engines... As the Luftwaffe launches its aerial offensive, the outnumbered Royal Air Force is scrambling to bring into combat new planes that will ensure victory over a stronger foe. Will they succeed? It’s up to you, and your Hurricane or Spitfire.

Because many of the missions take place in the Amazon jungle, there will often be plenty of thick vegetation to hide in.”<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ></h2> “I can see appeal to both ways of playing Sniper: one for its increased sense of satisfaction for hitting the shot -- complete with bullet chase cam to the perfect strike; the other for its simple pleasure of hitting a steady stream of headshots.”<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ></h2>“The great thing about Sniper: Ghost Warrior is that the “vision cone” of the game is insanely huge, so even though you might be hundreds of feet away from an enemy, they are more than capable of seeing you through a crack in a fence, or from across a canyon. It's a weird little element of the game that I found to be very impressive, something that was oddly realistic.”",

      "detailed_description": "Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 is the only multi-platform, first-person, modern shooter exclusively designed around the sniper experience. It takes the bulls-eye precision of its predecessor to new and exciting heights, offering more diverse sniper challenges; a rebuilt AI system and the thrilling “one shot, one kill” precision that made the original a huge hit, selling 3 million copies worldwide. Taking advantage of the advanced capabilities of the CryENGINE3, Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 also delivers striking graphic environments.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tMotion Sense Trigger System: an innovative first in which the way the player touches the controller influences the on-screen shot. Like in real-world sniping, in-game shooting requires a steady squeeze of the pad’s trigger so that when the round is fired, the rifle is more accurate. Jerk the trigger and the round is thrown off, thus missing the target and alerting a highly motivated enemy to your presence.<br></li><li>\tRealistic Ballistics: the hallmark of the Sniper franchise is the realism of its shooting dynamics.  Wind speed, distance, gravity and bullet-drop all play critical roles in the performance of your shot.<br></li><li>\tRefined Shooting Mechanics: a proper breathing technique to steady your heart rate is as important as calculating the time on target of your round, and the best snipers control both their heart and their head. From acquisition of target until the slow steady trigger pull, a sniper must pull together everything to achieve the ideal “one shot; one kill.”<br></li><li>\tImproved Enemy AI: the Artificial Intelligence (AI) system was completely re-tooled and designed from scratch.  Much of the improvements were made possible from the switch to the CryEngine 3. Expect everything from flanking movements to frontal assaults as the enemy tries to engage you in close quarters where your rifle is less effective.<br></li><li>\tNew Target-Rich Environments: Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 adds new urban environments like Sarajevo and treacherous mountain terrain to go along with jungles that are as lush and deadly as ever. <br></li><li>\tVarious Difficulty Levels: To diversify gameplay and make it accessible to the widest group of gamers, CI Games is introducing three difficulty levels that totally change the nature of the game. You decide how to play – either relax and be the ultimate predator or test your skill and experience the game on Expert Mode.<br></li><li>\tBullet-Cam: everyone’s favorite feature returns to reward expert shots and show the battlefield from a totally new viewpoint. See what the transfer of kinetic energy – a bullet’s true stopping power – can do to the enemy from 1000 meters or more!<br></li><li>\tBullet Penetration: concealment doesn’t necessarily mean cover. In Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2, bullets behave as they would in real life and are able to dispatch enemies hiding behind various types of covers. You can also try to line up your enemies and let a single round take out an entire squad. Wait ‘til you see that on Bullet Cam!<br></li><li>\tExpanded List of Sniper Rifles: Try out the world’s most advanced sniper rifles, each of them meticulously recreated so that they accurately simulate the modern weaponry found on today’s battlefields.<br></li><li>\tNew Gear: own the night with the introduction of thermal and night vision optics, plus a pair of powerful binoculars critical for locating the enemy before they spot you.</li></ul>",
